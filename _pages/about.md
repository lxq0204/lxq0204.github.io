I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Software, Shandong University. I receive a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence from Shandong University in 2024 and an M.S. in Control engineering from Shandong University in 2020. My research interests include computer vision, multimedia analysis, unsupervised domain adaptation, and scene text recognition and understanding.
